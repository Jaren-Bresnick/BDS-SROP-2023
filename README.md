# BDS-SROP-2023

This summer I was given the opportunity to participate in UW-Madisonâ€™s Biomedical Data Science Summer Research Program. 
I conducted research by leveraging machine learning models and data analysis tools to predict the effect of gene perturbations on cellular morphology. 
The program has significantly influenced my research interests, and I am now captivated by further exploring the intersection of machine learning and biology.
